# Changelog

## [v0.16] - 2026-01-05

### Added
-   **Glomap Integration**: Added support for [Glomap](https://github.com/colmap/glomap) as an alternative Structure-from-Motion (SfM) mapper.
    -   New parameter `--use_glomap` in CLI and "Utiliser Glomap" checkbox in GUI.
    -   Automatic installation checking at startup.
    -   Support for compiling Glomap from source (requires Xcode/Homebrew).

### Changed
-   **Dependency Management**: Refactored `setup_dependencies.py` to improve maintainability and reduce code duplication.
-   **Startup Flow**: The application now intelligently checks for missing engines or updates for all components (Brush, Sharp, SuperSplat, Glomap) at launch.

### Fixed
-   Fixed macOS compilation issues for Glomap by explicitly detecting and linking `libomp` (OpenMP) via Homebrew.

## [v0.15]
-   Initial support for Brush, Sharp, and SuperSplat integration.
